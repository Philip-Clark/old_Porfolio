# Old Portfolio of Philip Clark
A single page minimal portfolio web site made for college. Elements fade in based on scroll position, some elements also have entrance animations.
Has sleek design, is responsive, and functions very well.

This is considered the "old Portfolio" because I am currently designing and building a much more exstensive new one that better displays my work.
